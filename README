JEnumerable
---------------------------------

JEnumerable is a Java implementation of the system.linq.Enumerable class in .NET

The Java language hinders unlocking the true beauty/conciseness of LINQ but this is a best effort attempt and
was initially for educational purposes. 

I implemented this alongside reading Jon Skeet's blog series 'Reimplimenting LINQ to Objects'
(http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/archive/2010/09/03/reimplementing-linq-to-objects-part-1-introduction.aspx) 
therefore there are parallels with Jon's code especially in the test cases.

What JEnumerable cannot provide:
- Extension methods. The JEnumerable class wraps an Iterable<T> which is an acceptable alternative
- Lambda expressions. Unfortunately there's no good replacement for these. Anonymous classes are the compromise I chose to provide support for methods which take lambda expressions
